Paste List is a browser extension for Google Chrome that simplifies repeated pasting. Save lists of text, then enable a list to have each consecutive item automatically copied to your clipboard as you paste.

- Manage multiple lists of text
- Activate a list using the extension popup (pin the extension to make it easy to access)
- Press `Start` on the overlay that appears on the page and watch how the overlay updates with your clipboard as you paste
- `Skip` any list item when pasting or `Stop` it completely (it also stops if you make it to the end of the list or if you activate another list)

_Note that the active tab may be reloaded when the overlay is added to the page._
